# VIEWER

`DWT` comes with a `Viewer` component to help visualize the data in the buffer. To make things easy, the `Viewer` has within itself a built-in `Image Editor` UI.

## Bind the Viewer

As mentioned in [creating the WebTwain instance]({{site.indepth}}initialize.html#creating-the-webtwain-instance), a new `WebTwain` instance (or a new `DWT` object) usually comes with a ready-bound viewer which is an instance of the `Viewer` component. Only when you use [ `Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.CreateDWTObjectEx` ]({{site.indepth}}initialize.html#dynamsoftwebtwainenvcreatedwtobjectex) for the instantiation will you be able to get a `WebTwain` instance that doesn't have a viewer. In this case, you can still call the method [ `BindViewer()` ]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Viewer.html#bindviewer) to create and bind a `Viewer` instance.

## Customize the Viewer

The viewer is created inside a given `HTMLDivElement` specified by its `id` . If a `WebTwain` instance is created with a built-in viewer, you can specify the initial size of the viewer during the creation. For example, the following configuration specifies a *585px by 513px* viewer to be created in the `HTMLDivElement` with the `id` 'dwtcontrolContainer1'.

``` javascript
Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.Containers = [{
    ContainerId: 'dwtcontrolContainer1',
    Width: '585px',
    Height: '513px'
}]
```

If the viewer is bound after the creation of the `WebTwain` instance, the following does the same thing

``` javascript
DWObject.BindViewer('dwtcontrolContainer1', {
    Height: 513,
    Width: 585
});
```

After the initial binding, you can still call the method [ `UpdateViewer()` ]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Viewer.html#updateviewer) to customize the viewer. For example, the following changes the size of the viewer and enables dual-viewer mode at the same time

``` javascript
DWObject.UpdateViewer({
    Height: "500px",
    Width: "700px",
    view: {
        // Show the 2nd viewer
        bShow: true,
        // The 2nd viewer takes up 80% of the viewer width
        Width: "80%"
    }
});
```
