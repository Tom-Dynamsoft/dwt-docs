# Upgrade to include mobile functionality
If you are upgrading to version 16 for mobile functionality, there are some considerations to be made. As mobile support is one of the newest offerings from Dynamsoft, not all of the old DWT features are fully available at present. That said, we are constantly working on increasing the mobile supported feature set, so we recommend reviewing our*[release notes](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Products/WebTWAIN_News.aspx)*, and if you have any doubts, contact dynamsoft support.

As an example for how some existing DWT features will work on mobile, see below: 

Scanning -> this will become capturing from mobile cameras
Loading -> this is also just loading or capturing
Edit -> similar to existing desktop browser functionality
upload -> similiar to existing desktop browser functionality
barcode reading, pdf rasterizing ->identical to current desktop browser functionality
save -> supported, but it may not work as well on mobile since there isn't an equivalent idea to a file system, especially on iOS.
ocr -> not supported on mobile yet
