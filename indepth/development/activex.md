# ABOUT ACTIVEX

**ActiveX** is a software framework created by Microsoft which goes back to the year 1996. It was used extensively in Internet Explorer before `HTML5` stole its light. The technology is now considered deprecated as Microsoft has announced the deprecation plan of the legacy browser altogether.

Although `DWT` is now built upon modern technologies like `WebSocket` , `HTML5` , `WebAssemby` , we have nothing but gratitude towards the ActiveX framework because when `DWT` was first released in 2003, it was one of many ActiveX controls.
