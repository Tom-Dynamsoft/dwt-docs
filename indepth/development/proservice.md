# PROFESSIONAL SERVICE

Dynamsoft is devoted to making products as user-friendly as possible. In most cases, developers should be able to get started with the `DWT` library in a very short time and integrate it into the workflow of their applications successfully within a matter of days. The developers can get in touch with the [Dynamsoft Support Team]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) during the whole process.

However, we realize that some customers may require more advanced support from Dynamsoft and that's why we also provide the so-called paid professional service. We see the service applicable in the following occasions

## Virtual Developer Service

While most of our customers have their own development teams (some are developers themselves) and are satisfied to find `DWT` and related materials to build their applications, there are some customers who come to us in search of ready-made solutions. In other words, they'd rather get sample applications which have already the features they need instead of investigate into the details of the SDK themselves. In light of this, Dynamsoft provides a professional service called "Virtual Developer" (VDS for short). The idea is that Dynamsoft designate a team to help with the integration of `DWT` into the customers applications from requirements analysis to successful deployment.

The following is how VDS works

* Step 1: The customer sends over their requirements and other materials if required; 
* Step 2: Dynamsoft Team analyze the requirements and decide whether `DWT` meets them; 

> This step usually involves back-and-forth communication until the requirements are clear enough and that a decision can be made to go ahead or not.

* Step 3: Dynamsoft Team sends a quotation for the service as well as a quotation for the required licenses; 
* Step 4: The customer makes the payment; 
* Step 5: Dynamsoft designate a team to the project. The team usually consists of a case manager, a developer and a tester; 
* Step 6: The designated team finishes the project before the agreed deadline and continues to maintain it during the agreed maintenance period.

## Customization Service

Dynamsoft provides many public samples and code snippets free of cost to all customers. The code in these materials can be customized at will. However, the [resources files]({{site.about}}faqs.html#what-are-the-resources-files) are provided "as is" and should not be changed unless otherwise mentioned in this documentation (for example, the file `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js` is an exception). If you would like to change any of these files, you must first consult [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to know whether or not it can be done and whether or not it might involve the Dynamsoft Team. If it involves considerable extra efforts from Dynamsoft, the paid Customization Service (CS) may apply.

The difference between VDS and CS is that the latter involves changes to the `DWT` SDK itself and is considered much more complicated. Other than that, the steps are the same as VDS.

If you are interested in the professional service, please contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html).
