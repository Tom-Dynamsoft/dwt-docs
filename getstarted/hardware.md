# HARDWARE

The profile of our dwt users is basically like this

1. Acquire images
2. Upload

Other features are mostly optional.

So this article is supposed to show users our compliance with hardware which includes 

* TWAIN 
* ICA 
* SANE
* DIRECTSHOW
* CAMERA through H5 (MediaDevices)

Hopefully this article alone can handle most queries users have about hardware.
